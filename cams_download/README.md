# download_CAMS_daily

This tool is designed to download daily CAMS near-real-time forecast products from ECMWF. Otherwise, the graphical interface provided by ECMWF is available here: http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/macc-nrealtime/levtype=sfc/

The tool downloads several types of fields :
- the Aerosol Optical Thickness AOT, for 5 types of aerosols, which are stored in the AOT file
- the mixing ratios of each aerosol types as a function of altitude (expressed as model levels), stored in MR file 
- the Relative Humidity as a function of altitude expressed in pressure levels, stored in the RH file.

These files are available currently twice a day, and some of the aprameters are only availble as a 3 hour forecast, and not an analysis. The files are downloaded in netCDF format and look like this:
```
CAMS_AOT_yyyymmdd_UTC_hhmm.nc
CAMS_MR_yyyymmdd_UTC_hhmm.nc
CAMS_RH_yyyymmdd_UTC_hhmm.nc
```

The files are then converted in one archive using the Earth Explorer format, which was selected as the standard format for MAJA external data. We have a HDR xml file, and a bzipped DBL archive, which contains the three files above for a given time and date. (I regret this choice which complexifies the use of data within MAJA, compared to using the plain netCDF files, but it the current situation)



# Configuration

 - Create a ECMWF account: https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/

 - The folder ecmwfapi/ and the file setup.py must be in the working directory.

 - Get your API key at: https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/

 - Create the file '.ecmwfapirc' in your home and type:
```
{
"url" : "https://api.ecmwf.int/v1",
"key" : "your_key",
"email" : "your_email_address"
}
```

# Example

`python download_CAMS_daily.py -d 20180101 -f 20180102  -w /path/to/my/CAMSfolderNetCDF -a  /path/to/my/CAMSfolderNetDBL`


# Parameters

The user can choose the following parameters with the command line:

 - w: where CAMS files will be stored

 - d,f: min/max range of dates to download

 - w: path to folder where netcdf data are stored (can be considered as a temporary file)
 - a: path to folder where DBL/HDR files are stored
 - k: to keep the netcdf files
 - p: The platform identifier

Other parameters could be accessed within the code :

 - step: forecast step in hours (default 3, ony value available so far)

 - type of file to download: surface, pressure or model (default all)

 - name of output files

 - grid: spatial resolution of downloaded files

 - format: grib or netcdf

# Info on downloaded files

 - Surface files: Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) at 550 nm for the five aerosol models (BlackCarbon, Dust, Sulfate, SeaSalt and OrganicMatter).
```
